### About

The project is divided in eight different parts representing different views. The project's interactions are as well separated within the different controllers. In order to keep the project within the object-oriented paradigm, we have tried to eliminate and any kind of repeated methods. The views are separated from the model, and they do not change the model directly, and, as the instructions describe, no graphics are used or imported into the model. We have used the framework Angular as learned in the different labs. Furthermore, we use Node.js, Firebase and Heroku.
