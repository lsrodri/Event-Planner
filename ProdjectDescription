NoSQL mobile service is also used as well as Firebase in order to store user data.

This project is developed using JavaScript and HTML languages and makes use of the framework Angular.js. The project consist of several particles of the same model and thereby displaying the different events which are happening in the city in real time. This events can the user save in a list or calendar. Events can be added and removed.
